During my time working as a pharmacy technician in a community setting I've learned that part of the job of a pharmacy manager is to deal with statistical data pertaining to sales, prescriptions entered into the computer system, and prescriptions put back into stock.
Although I don't have any personal experience in a hospital setting, the data involved will be similar, though I imagine there will be less emphasis on sales.
